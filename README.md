# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Prediction

The main aim of this project is to detect Cotton Plant diseases with the help of Image Processing techniques by using Deep Learning methods. 
In this project classification models such as Custom CNN, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 has been used and compared with other existing methodologies. At last, a Hybrid Model (ResNet50 and DenseNet121) was used which gave not only a better accuracy in detecting and classifying the diseases but also was faster when compared to other existing methodologies.
